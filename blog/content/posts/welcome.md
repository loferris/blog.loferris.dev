# Welcome!

I'm Lo Ferris, a full-stack developer and writer who's passionate about indie hacking and developer relations! This blog will feature: 

- Projects and tutorials: These are various diy small projects building tools and resources that make my workflow more mindful and pleasant.
- Interviews and industry analysis: I regularly interview other developers and writers about their processes and occasionally write "takes" on various corners of SaaS.
-  Personal updates: This may include bigger project launching and community news!

I hope to see you again! ^.^
